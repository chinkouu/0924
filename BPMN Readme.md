How to test a BPMN tool using this test suite?
----------------------------------------------

Everybody is welcome to test BPMN tools and submit results to the working group, not just tools vendors.
Here is how you do it:

### 1. Download Test Cases
First download the [latest version of the BPMN Model Interchange Test Suite](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite/archive/master.zip) and unpack it.
The top level directories of the test suite distinguish different categories of tests.
Inside each category there is a directory called `Reference`, which contains the files needed for testing.
Next to that, there will be multiple folders with test results of other tools.

### 2. Test Import, Export and/or Roundtrip of BPMN Models.
There are [three different test procedures](#detailed-descrition-of-test-procedures) that can be performed
with the provided reference models depending on the capabilities of the tool.
You will find explanations of these three procedures [below](#detailed-descrition-of-test-procedures).

### 3. Submit Your Test Results to BPMN MIWG
Package all result files in a zip file and send it via email to [MIWG@trisotech.com](mailto:MIWG@trisotech.com).
Make sure to provide the exact name and version of the tool that you tested in the email.

Alternatively, you may also [fork the repository](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite/fork_select) on GitHub
and submit test results through a [pull request](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite/pull/new/master).

Usually one day after your submission our [automated tools](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-tools)
should have generated a [report that shows findings in your submitted files](http://tools.bpmn-miwg.cloudbees.net/).

Note: By submitting test results you agree that they will be published under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_CA">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>.

### 1. BPMN MIWG Import Test Procedure
If the tool under test supports the import of BPMN XML files, you can test that feature using the following procedure:

1. Import the BPMN XML file (*.bpmn) provided with a [reference model](#1-download-test-cases) into the tool, e.g. `A.1.0.bpmn`.
1. Save the graphical representation of the model as imported to a file named `<test id>-import.<file type>`, e.g. `A.1.0-import.png`.
You can either do that through an export feature of the tool, e.g. a PNG, JPEG or PDF Export, or by taking a screenshot of the canvas.
1. Compare the result with the image provided with the reference model, e.g. `A.1.0.pdf`.
1. Report your findings in the spreadsheet `BPMN MIWG Test Case Structure.xlsx` by putting either `OK` or `Issues` into a column labeled with tool name, version and date of test.
1. [Create new issues](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite/issues/new) on GitHub – one for each of your findings. Make sure to mention the tool you tested, the id of the test case (e.g. `A.1.0`) and the type of the test (e.g. `import`) in the issue title. (A moderator will create labels out of that.)

Repeat these steps for all reference models and [submit your test results to BPMN MIWG](#3-submit-your-test-results-to-bpmn-miwg).

### 2. BPMN MIWG Export Test Procedure
If the tool under test supports the export of BPMN XML files, you can test that feature using the following procedure:

1. Draw the model as shown in the image provided with a [reference model](#1-download-test-cases) into the tool, e.g. `A.1.0.pdf`.
1. Save the graphical representation of the model as drawn to a file named `<test id>-export.<file type>`, e.g. `A.1.0-export.png`.
You can either do that through an export feature of the tool, e.g. a PNG, JPEG or PDF Export, or by taking a screenshot of the canvas.
1. Export the model into a BPMN XML file (*.bpmn) named `<test id>-export.bpmn`, e.g. `A.1.0-export.bpmn`.
1. Compare the result with the BPMN XML file (*.bpmn) provided with the reference model, e.g. `A.1.0.bpmn`.
1. Report your findings in the spreadsheet `BPMN MIWG Test Case Structure.xlsx` by putting either `OK` or `Issues` into a column labeled with tool name, version and date of test.
1. [Create new issues](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite/issues/new) on GitHub – one for each of your findings. Make sure to mention the tool you tested, the id of the test case (e.g. `A.1.0`) and the type of the test (e.g. `export`) in the issue title. (A moderator will create labels out of that.)

Repeat these steps for all reference models and [submit your test results to BPMN MIWG](#3-submit-your-test-results-to-bpmn-miwg).

### 3. BPMN MIWG Roundtrip Test Procedure (BPMN Import and Export combined)
If the tool under test supports the import and export of BPMN XML files, you can test a roundtrip using the following procedure:

1. Import the BPMN XML file (*.bpmn) provided with a [reference model](#1-download-test-cases) into the tool, e.g. `A.1.0.bpmn`.
1. If not already done during an import test, save the graphical representation of the model as it is imported to a file named `<test id>-import.<file type>`, e.g. `A.1.0-import.png`.
You can either do that through an export feature of the tool, e.g. a PNG, JPEG or PDF Export, or by taking a screenshot of the canvas.
1. Export the model into a BPMN XML file (*.bpmn) named `<test id>-roundtrip.bpmn`, e.g. `A.1.0-roundtrip.bpmn`.
1. Compare the result with the BPMN XML file (*.bpmn) provided with the reference model, e.g. `A.1.0.bpmn`.
1. Report your findings in the spreadsheet `BPMN MIWG Test Case Structure.xlsx` by putting either `OK` or `Issues` into a column labeled with tool name, version and date of test.
1. [Create new issues](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite/issues/new) on GitHub – one for each of your findings. Make sure to mention the tool you tested, the id of the test case (e.g. `A.1.0`) and the type of the test (e.g. `roundtrip`) in the issue title. (A moderator will create labels out of that.)

Repeat these steps for all reference models and [submit your test results to BPMN MIWG](#3-submit-your-test-results-to-bpmn-miwg).

### 4. BPMN Import and Export not supported
If the tool does neither support import nor export of BPMN XML files you can not perform the tests described above. However, if the tool supports other model interchange formats, we are still interested to record this information:

1. Open the spreadsheet `BPMN MIWG Test Case Structure.xlsx`, add a column labeled with tool name, version and date of test, and enter a text like:

> The BPMN XML format is not supported. Model Interchange is only possible in the `XPDL` format. However, this has not been tested by the BPMN MIWG.

Repository Structure
--------------------

The top level defines test categories. 
The second level is either a vendor or the submitted reference. 
The third level holds the individual test case files in the form `<identifier>-<test type>.filetype`.

The vendor who provided the reference model for a test case will be identified in the summarizing spreadsheet `BPMN MIWG Test Case Structure.xlsx`.
